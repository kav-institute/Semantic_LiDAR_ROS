# Sensor Setup
Our demo is tailored to a Ouster OS2-128 Rev 7. We use the ouster-sdk==0.12.0. 
> [!NOTE]
> The release version of the Ouster SDK and OusterStudio had a major revision!
> 
> Ensure you use a suitable version for OusterStudio, Ouster SDK, and sensor firmware (we use: "ousteros-image-prod-aries-v2.5.2+20230714195410").
> 
> We use the LEGACY config for our Ouster recodings and record at 2048@10Hz.
